You can really tell that he is not lazy when designing lessons and he makes everything count. I would pay double tuition to have Ramon teach all of my computer science classes.",

I wish you luck on the adventure of 222.",

If you are ever undecided about your major please just take Computer Science so you can attend Gaos classes, nothing will ever compare to the high quality teaching that takes place in COSC320.

He explains concepts thoroughly in class, sometimes going a bit slow, but I never found him too boring. Only has a slight accent, and he has a bit of a funny side. Overall an enjoyable course, made better by a great, if inexperienced, professor.",
